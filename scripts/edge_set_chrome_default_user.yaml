  ## Purpose
  Sets Google Chrome as the default browser for the current user. Uses SetUserFTA to properly set file associations with the correct UserChoice hash that Windows 10/11 requires. MUST run as the logged-in user (not SYSTEM) - default browser settings are per-user and stored in HKCU with hash validation.

  ## Usage
  - Run as logged-in user (NOT as SYSTEM)
  - Configure boolean settings at top of script for specific associations (http, https, .htm, .html)
  - Set `$cleanUserStartup = $true` to remove Edge from user's startup programs

  ## Requirements
  - PowerShell 5.1 or later
  - Must run as logged-in user (NOT as SYSTEM)
  - Google Chrome must be installed
  - Internet access (to download SetUserFTA if needed)
