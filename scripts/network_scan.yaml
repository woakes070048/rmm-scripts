  -------

  Scans a range of IP addresses using multi-threaded ping requests to discover active
  hosts on the network. Optionally resolves hostnames via DNS.


  Usage Notes

  -----------

  - Edit startIP and endIP variables to set scan range

  - Set disableDNS to true to skip hostname resolution (faster)

  - Adjust threads variable to control concurrency (default: 32)

  - Results sorted by IP address with hostname if DNS enabled


  Requirements

  ------------

  - Windows PowerShell 5.1 or later

  - Network access to target IP range
