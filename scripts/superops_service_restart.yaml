  -------

  Restarts RMM agent services on Windows systems. Automatically detects if the

  script is being executed by the RMM agent itself and uses a safe background

  restart approach to avoid terminating mid-execution.


  Usage Notes

  -----------

  - Set service filter via $YourServiceFilterHere (e.g., "limehawk")

  - Filter converted to wildcard pattern *filter* for service discovery

  - When running from RMM agent: spawns background process with 30-second delay

  - When running manually: restarts services directly and waits for completion

  - Reports status of each service after restart


  Requirements

  ------------

  - Windows 10/11

  - Administrator privileges

  - PowerShell 5.1+

  - Target RMM agent installed (matching services must exist)
