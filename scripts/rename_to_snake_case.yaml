  and lowercases all characters.

  Usage Notes
  -----------
  - Set target directory via SuperOps runtime variable $YourTargetPathHere
  - Processes child items first (bottom-up) to avoid path issues
  - Skips items already in snake_case format
  - Reports each rename operation and final counts
  - WARNING: Cannot be undone - backup important directories first

  Requirements
  ------------
  - Windows 10/11
  - Write permissions to target directory
