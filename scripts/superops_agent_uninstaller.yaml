  Purpose:

  Performs a quiet uninstallation of the SuperOps RMM Agent using the MSI
  ProductCode GUID. Reports which uninstall method (WMI or CIM) was used,
  provides diagnostic information, and checks for leftover services to suggest
  manual cleanup commands.


  Usage Notes:

  - No runtime inputs required - ProductCode GUID is hardcoded

  - Tries WMI first, falls back to CIM if WMI fails

  - Reports product details (name, version, publisher, method used)

  - Missing product treated as success (already removed)

  - Post-uninstall service check displays cleanup commands if needed


  Requirements:

  - PowerShell 5.1+

  - Run as Administrator

  - Windows operating system
