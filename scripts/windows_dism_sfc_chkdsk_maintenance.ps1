 SCRIPT   : Windows DISM SFC Chkdsk Maintenance                          v2.0.0

DESCRIPTION : Runs DISM, SFC, and chkdsk for Windows system file repair
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PURPOSE
 Runs standard Windows health checks and repair commands including DISM image
 health scans, disk checks, system file verification, and component cleanup.
 Designed for unattended execution in RMM environments to perform routine
 system maintenance and repair operations.

 DATA SOURCES & PRIORITY
 1) Hardcoded values (defined within the script body)
 2) System commands (DISM, chkdsk, sfc)
 3) Error

 REQUIRED INPUTS
 - RunDismScan       : $true
   (Whether to run DISM ScanHealth to check for image corruption.)
 - RunDismRestore    : $true
   (Whether to run DISM RestoreHealth - only runs if ScanHealth finds corruption.)
 - RunChkdsk         : $false
   (Whether to run chkdsk on local drives. Requires reboot to complete.)
 - RunSfc            : $true
   (Whether to run System File Checker to verify and repair system files.)
 - ChkdskParameters  : '/scan'
   (Parameters for chkdsk. Use '/scan' for quick scan or '/f /r' for full check.)
 - RebootAfterMaintenance : $false
   (Whether to reboot the system after maintenance with a 5-minute warning.)

 SETTINGS
 - All maintenance operations are optional via hardcoded input flags.
 - DISM operations use online mode against the running Windows installation.
 - chkdsk runs against all fixed local drives (DriveType = 3).
 - Commands run synchronously with full output captured for logging.

 BEHAVIOR
 - Script runs each enabled maintenance operation in sequence.
 - DISM RestoreHealth only runs if ScanHealth detects corruption (saves time on healthy systems).
 - Each operation's success or failure is tracked individually.
 - chkdsk requires admin rights and may schedule operations on next reboot.
 - Failed operations are reported but script continues to next operation.

 PREREQUISITES
 - PowerShell 5.1 or later.
 - Administrator privileges required.
 - Windows 8.1/Server 2012 R2 or later for DISM commands.
 - Sufficient disk space for repair operations.

 SECURITY NOTES
 - No secrets are printed to the console.
 - Requires elevated permissions to modify system components.
 - Operations may cause system modifications and require reboots.

 ENDPOINTS
 - N/A (local system commands only)

 EXIT CODES
 - 0 success (all enabled operations completed)
 - 1 failure (one or more operations failed)

 EXAMPLE RUN

 [ INPUT VALIDATION ]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 RunDismScan      : True
 RunDismRestore   : True
 RunChkdsk        : False
 RunSfc           : True
 ChkdskParameters : /scan

 [ DISM SCAN HEALTH ]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 Starting DISM image scan...
 No component store corruption detected.
 Result : Success (no corruption)

 [ DISM RESTORE HEALTH ]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 Skipped - no corruption detected by ScanHealth

 [ SYSTEM FILE CHECK ]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 Starting system file verification...
 Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.
 Result : Success (no integrity violations)

 [ FINAL STATUS ]
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 Operations Run    : 2
 Operations Passed : 2
 Operations Failed : 0
 Overall Result    : Success

 CHANGELOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2025-12-28 v2.0.0 Smart logic: RestoreHealth only runs if ScanHealth finds corruption; removed ComponentCleanup
 2025-12-28 v1.2.0 Use exit codes instead of string parsing for DISM/SFC result detection
 2025-12-23 v1.1.0 Updated to Limehawk Script Framework
 2025-10-31 v1.0.3 Added full command output display for all operations (DISM and SFC)
 2025-10-31 v1.0.2 Fixed DISM component cleanup access denied errors
 2025-10-31 v1.0.1 Added optional reboot functionality with 5-minute warning
 2025-10-31 v1.0.0 Initial release
