  Purpose

  -------

  Configures Windows to use UTC for the hardware clock instead of local time.
  This prevents the clock from being wrong when switching between Windows and
  Linux on dual-boot systems, as Linux uses UTC by default.


  Usage Notes

  -----------

  - Sets RealTimeIsUniversal registry value to 1 in TimeZoneInformation

  - No configurable inputs required

  - Run once after installing Windows on a dual-boot system


  Requirements

  ------------

  - PowerShell 5.1 or later

  - Administrator privileges (required for HKLM access)

  - Windows 10/11
