  ## Purpose

  Downloads the Canon imageCLASS MF455dw MF Driver package from Canon's CDN,
  extracts it, and installs the UFR II LT printer driver to the Windows driver
  store using pnputil. Optionally creates a TCP/IP printer queue if an IP
  address is specified.


  ## Usage Notes

  - Configure via hardcoded variables: `$driverUrl`, `$printerIp`,
  `$printerName`, `$installScanner`

  - Driver extracts to C:\Temp\CanonMF455dw and is cleaned up after installation

  - Leave `$printerIp` empty to install driver only without creating a printer
  queue


  ## Requirements

  - Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+

  - Administrator privileges

  - Network connectivity to Canon CDN (gdlp01.c-wss.com)

  - curl.exe (included in Windows 10 1803+)
