  ## Purpose

  Automates the deployment process for all running Dokploy applications. Fetches
  application metadata via the Dokploy API, checks each app's status, and
  triggers deployments only for apps that are currently running. Idle
  applications are skipped.


  ## Usage Notes

  - Configure DOKPLOY_DOMAIN and API_TOKEN in script before running

  - Adds 2-second delay between deployments to avoid API rate limits

  - Skips applications with "idle" status

  - API calls use HTTPS for encrypted communication


  ## Requirements

  - curl installed

  - Network connectivity to Dokploy domain

  - Valid Dokploy API token with deployment permissions
