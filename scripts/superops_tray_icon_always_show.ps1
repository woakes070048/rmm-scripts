 SCRIPT   : SuperOps Tray Icon Always Show                                v1.4.0
 AUTHOR   : Limehawk.io

DESCRIPTION : Configures Windows to always show SuperOps tray icon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PURPOSE

   *** MUST RUN AS LOGGED-IN USER - NOT SYSTEM ***

   Configures Windows system tray settings to always show the SuperOps RMM
   agent tray icon. This ensures the SuperOps icon remains visible in the
   system tray notification area rather than being hidden in the overflow.

   Modifies HKCU registry which is per-user. Running as SYSTEM will modify
   SYSTEM's registry, not the user's - and will have no effect.

 DATA SOURCES & PRIORITY
 1) Windows Registry (HKCU:\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings)
 2) Hardcoded search pattern ("superops")

 REQUIRED INPUTS
 None - Script automatically detects and configures SuperOps tray icon settings

 SETTINGS
 - Searches all notification icon registry entries for SuperOps-related entries
 - Sets IsPromoted=1 for matching entries (makes icon always visible)
 - Processes all users' notification area settings under HKCU context
 - Uses case-insensitive pattern matching for "superops"

 BEHAVIOR
 - Checks Windows version and exits with error on unsupported OS
 - Exits gracefully (exit 0) if registry path doesn't exist yet
 - Enumerates all subkeys in HKCU:\Control Panel\NotifyIconSettings
 - Searches each key's properties for strings containing "superops"
 - When a match is found, sets the IsPromoted DWORD value to 1
 - Reports each modification made to the console
 - Continues processing even if individual keys fail to read
 - No restart required - changes take effect on next tray icon update

 PREREQUISITES

   - Windows 11 (build 22000 or later) - older Windows versions not supported
   - PowerShell 5.1 or later
   - *** MUST RUN AS LOGGED-IN USER (NOT SYSTEM) ***
   - SuperOps agent must be installed (creates notification icon entries)
   - No elevation required (modifies current user's registry only)

 SECURITY NOTES
 - No secrets or credentials used
 - Only modifies current user's notification settings
 - Does not affect system-wide or other users' settings
 - Read-only access to detect SuperOps entries
 - Write access only to IsPromoted value (standard Windows setting)

 ENDPOINTS
 - N/A (local registry modification only)

 EXIT CODES
 - 0 success
 - 1 failure
