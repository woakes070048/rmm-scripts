readme: '## Purpose

  Applies machine-wide policies to suppress Microsoft Edge nagging behaviors. Stops
  Edge from prompting to become default, auto-importing from other browsers, running
  in background, and showing promotional UI elements. Run as SYSTEM via RMM - this
  is the machine policy script.


  ## Usage

  - All options default to `$true` (suppress everything)

  - Set individual options to `$false` to keep specific Edge behaviors

  - Disables UI prompts, features (Collections, Shopping, Copilot), background behavior,
  and scheduled tasks


  ## Requirements

  - PowerShell 5.1 or later

  - Administrator privileges required (runs as SYSTEM via RMM)

  - Windows 10/11 with Microsoft Edge installed
